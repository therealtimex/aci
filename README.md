# Aipolabs Core Components

## Project Structure
Currently only contains the app server code, database (shared) and cli,
but can be extended to include more services (e.g., separate admin server, sdk, etc.) as a monorepo if needed.

## App Server
Follow all guidelines below for setting up the development environment, running services and testing locally for the app server.


<details>
  <summary>Setup</summary>

  - Git clone the repo
  - Python ^3.12
  - Install `docker`
  - Install `poetry`
  - Activate virtual env: `poetry shell`
    - We use docker and docker compose to run components in a container, so using a virtual env is more for development purposes. (IDE, pytest, dev dependencies, etc.)
  - Install dependencies: `poetry install`
  - Set up `.env` file according to `.env.example`, it's for running locally and pytest only
  - Coding style
    - all the following tools are part of `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies, and are automatically installed when running `poetry install`
    - use `black` to format the code
    - use `flake8` to lint the code
    - use `mypy` to type check the code
    - use `isort` to sort the imports
    - use `pre-commit` to run the above tools as pre-commit hooks
  - Install `pre-commit` hooks: `pre-commit install`
  - Setup you preferred editor to use `Black` formatter
    - e.g., you might need to install `Black` formatter extension in VS Code, and configure the setting as below
      ```json
      {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter"
      }
      ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Run postgreSQL and app server in Docker locally</summary>

  - Build app server and start the database and app server
    - `docker-compose up --build`
  - Set up the database (running in docker) with the latest migration 
    - `alembic upgrade head`
  - (Optional) Connect to the database using a GUI client like `DBeaver`
    - Parameters for the db connection can be found in the `.env` file
  - You can access the `Swagger UI` at `http://localhost:8000/v1/docs`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>If any changes are made to the database or it's models</summary>

  - You need to generate a new migration, which will generate a new file in `database/alembic/versions/`
  - First check if new upgrade operations detected: `alembic check`
  - If so, generate a new migration file: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<some message>"`
  - (If needed) Change the generated file in `database/alembic/versions/` to add the necessary changes (that are not auto-generated), e.g.,:
    - import `pgvector` library for `Vector` type
    - create and drop necessary indexes
    - create and drop vector extension
    - ...  
  - Apply the changes to the **local** database: `alembic upgrade head`
  - (If needed) you can undo the last change to the database: `alembic downgrade -1`
  - Test the changes by `pytest` and local end to end tests
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Run pytest</summary>

  - Make sure a local db is running by `docker-compose up db` (no need to run `app` server for `pytest`)
  - Make sure you have applied the latest migrations to the database, and all tables are empty
    - `alembic upgrade head`
  - Run tests
    - `pytest -vv -s`
</details>


## CLI
Follow the [CLI instructions](cli/README.md) for the cli module.
